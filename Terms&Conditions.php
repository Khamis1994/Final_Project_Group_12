        account holder for all activities that occur under his password or under his account. In addition, you 
        must inform us of any unauthorized use of your password or account. Finally, the site is not liable, 
        directly or indirectly, in any way, for any loss or damage of any kind, which may result from, or at

        or cancel any order. In the event that a product is not priced correctly, what we may do, in our sole 
        discretion, is to contact you for instructions or cancel your order after notifying you of such 
        cancellation. We have the right to refuse or cancel any orders, whether or not the order has been 
        confirmed and the fees have been added to the credit card.</p>
